# WeatherCore Masterplan

## 📌 App Overview and Objectives

WeatherCore is a **personal weather dashboard** designed to deliver **hyper-local, real-time weather intelligence** in a beautifully vintage UI. Built for a weather-savvy couple, the app combines **AI-assisted insights, radar visualization, and customizable alerts** into a sleek, NOAA-inspired interface.

## 🎯 Target Audience

* Primary: Homeowner (weather enthusiast)
* Secondary: Partner/spouse who prefers clear, concise daily weather updates
* Future: Nearby friends, family, or neighbors within a 20-mile radius

## 🌟 Core Features and Functionality

* **Homepage Dashboard**: Real-time conditions, hourly/daily collapsible forecasts, radar preview, light/dark toggle, and weather alerts.
* **Radar Page**: Interactive radar with customizable overlays (precipitation, wind, cloud cover, temperature), loop controls, and radius settings.
* **Forecast Explorer**: Detailed 7-day and hourly breakdowns, data trend graphs, astronomical info, and historical weather data.
* **AI Assistant**: Voice or chat interface for natural language queries about forecast conditions.
* **Custom Alerts**: Smart notifications based on configurable thresholds (e.g., wind, rain, freezing temps).

## 🧰 High-Level Technical Stack

* **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
* **Backend & DB**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions)
* **Auth**: Email/password, optional Google OAuth
* **Notifications**: Web Push API + Supabase triggers
* **AI Assistant**: OpenAI for NLU, integrated via API or Edge Functions

## 🗂️ Conceptual Data Model

* **User**: id, email, location, preferences, alert settings
* **WeatherSnapshot**: timestamp, temp, humidity, wind, UV, etc.
* **Forecast**: hourly + daily JSON blobs
* **RadarTile**: coordinates, type, timestamp
* **Alert**: type, condition, user\_id, triggered\_at
* **QueryLog**: user\_id, question, AI\_response, timestamp

## 🎨 User Interface Design Principles

* **Vintage aesthetic** with modern responsiveness
* Mobile-first with grid-based, card-style layouts
* Accessible colors and high contrast modes
* Collapsible sections for content density control
* Radar and AI interactions prioritized above the fold

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Supabase RLS for multi-user support and private data
* Optional 2FA for account security
* Limit AI input rate to prevent misuse
* Secure weather data fetching via backend proxy if needed

## 🚧 Development Phases

1. **Phase 1: MVP**

   * Homepage Dashboard
   * Radar Page (basic overlays)
   * Manual data fetch from weather APIs
   * Static login system

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced UX**

   * Forecast Explorer with graphs and trends
   * Push notifications
   * Light/dark theme toggle

3. **Phase 3: AI Integration**

   * Voice + chat assistant
   * Historical query log

4. **Phase 4: Polish and Expansion**

   * Advanced radar filters
   * Shareable weather snapshots
   * Invite-only multi-user setup (friends/family)

## ⚠️ Potential Challenges & Solutions

* **Weather API limits** → Cache hourly pulls and store in Supabase
* **Radar performance on mobile** → Use WebGL or canvas render fallback
* **Voice assistant accuracy** → Add autocomplete prompts and fallback phrases

## 🔮 Future Expansion Possibilities

* Personal weather station integration
* Smart home alerts (e.g., Nest thermostat tie-ins)
* Apple Watch companion
* Neighborhood weather leaderboard or activity feed
